# Model of ultrasound propagation

COMPILING
--------------------
This model runs on every system with any C/C++ compiler, but g++ is preferred. 
OpenGL library is also required to compile the software: https://www.opengl.org/.
To take advantage of multi-core processor architecture OpenMP library is needed, 
don't forget to specify OpenMP argument when compiling.
